  SCENE.—_Apartment in MR. CLAPBOARD’S home. Lounge c., back.
    Black velvet breakfast-jacket and smoking-cap lying across
    the corner. Small table, R. Chairs, R. and L. Entrances, R.
    and L._


    _Enter MR. CLAPBOARD, R., followed by EBENEZER
                   CROTCHET._

_Clapboard._ This is the room, sir.

_Ebenezer._ O, it is! This is the mysterious abode of my runaway son.
Well, I don’t see anything very inviting here; a few miserable chairs,
a rickety lounge, a mean little table—

_Clap._ Come, come, sir; don’t abuse my furniture.

_Eben._ O, pooh, pooh! What business have you harboring a runaway scamp
who ought to be at home, you old, gray-headed ruffian?

_Clap._ Come, come, sir; once for all, I won’t be abused in my
own house. If your son chooses to hire a room in my house, to pay
handsomely for the same, and to behave himself in a gentlemanly manner,
here he stops just as long as he pays, you old heathen.

_Eben._ Old heathen! Confound you, do you know who you are talking to,
Mr. Claptrap?

_Clap._ Clapboard, sir; Clapboard is my name.

_Eben._ Do you know who you are talking to?

_Clap._ I’ve a pretty good idea. Some fiery old lunatic just escaped
from Bedlam.

_Eben._ Fire and fury! I’ll break this cane over your head, insolent!

_Clap._ Do; and then I’ll throw you and the pieces down those stairs,
catamount!

_Eben._ (_Aside._) O, this won’t do. (_Aloud._) I beg your pardon, Mr.
Claptrap.

_Clap._ Clapboard, sir.

_Eben._ Mr. Clapboard, I was a little hasty. You must attribute it to
the anxiety of a devoted parent. I have a son.

_Clap._ So I understand.

_Eben._ A week ago he left the parental mansion, for the purpose, as
he said, of recruiting himself at a quiet place in the country. All
very well, of course. I could bring nothing to say against that; but
yesterday I received an anonymous note, mailed at this place, bidding
me look out for my son, who, the note said, had formed a tender
attachment. Do you hear?—a tender attachment!

_Clap._ Well, what of it?

_Eben._ What of it? Hear the man! Sir! Mr. Claptrap!

_Clap._ Clapboard, sir.

_Eben._ Mr. Clapboard. Ten years ago I retired from the soap and candle
business with a fortune. This boy is my only son; young, impulsive,
thoughtless, he has come to the country; his susceptible heart is a
target, at which a thousand loving glances will be thrown by the eyes
of rural beauties—

_Clap._ Humbug! There isn’t a female within three miles of the
place. This is called “Bachelors’ Paradise.” There’s Jobson’s house,
Seymour’s, and mine; specially erected for the convenience of artists,
fishermen, and such like gentry, who want a quiet place in the country.

_Eben._ Is it possible! Then my son’s tender attachment—

_Clap._ It’s some trick played to frighten you.

_Eben._ Perhaps it is, but I have my doubts. Who lodges in this house
besides my son?

_Clap._ Well, sir, on the floor below, there’s Mr. Timothy Tinpan, a
nice, gentlemanly—tinker.

_Eben._ A tinker?—(_Aside._) Bachelors’ Paradise! (_Aloud._)
Gentlemanly humbug! Who else?

_Clap._ The next floor above is occupied by Mr. Peter Picket, a
military gentleman, who served his country in the great rebellion.

_Eben._ A soldier! (_Noise outside._) What’s that?

_Clap._ That’s him. He’s always going through his tactics. He dropped
his gun.

_Eben._ Did he! Then Mr. Peter Picket had better _pick it_ up. Well,
who else?

_Clap._ Next above him is Mr. Oakum, a well-mannered mariner, engaged
in the lumber trade.

_Eben._ Is that all?

_Clap._ No, sir; the floor above him, next the roof, is occupied by Mr.
Loopstitch, a tailor, a native of France.

_Eben._ Soldier, sailor, tinker, and tailor! Here’s nice company for my
boy.

_Clap._ O, they’re a nice, gentlemanly set, I assure you; very quiet.
Mr. Picket is apt to be a little restless nights; walks in his sleep;
and sometimes wanders about the house with a loaded musket. Mr.
Oakum is of rather a musical turn, and has his “bark upon the sea” a
little too often. Mr. Tinpan is very fond of rehearsing his war-cry,
“Old kettles to mend;” and Mr. Loopstitch is making frantic efforts
to master the trombone. But generally they are quiet, gentlemanly,
respectable individuals.

_Eben._ I should say so. And my son abandons his luxurious home, his
highly respectable connections, for such society as this?

_Clap._ Lord bless you, young gentlemen have their little freaks, you
know.

_Eben._ And so have old gentlemen too. I have a very sudden one myself.
For how long has my son engaged this room?

_Clap._ Let me see; he has paid me for it up to six o’clock to-night.

_Eben._ And after that I suppose it will be to let.

_Clap._ Of course. Though probably he’ll keep it himself.

_Eben._ Hark you, Mr. Claptrap.

_Clap._ Clapboard, sir.

_Eben._ Mr. Clapboard, I want to hire this room myself. What does my
son pay you?

_Clap._ Six dollars a week. Cheap enough.

_Eben._ All right. I’ll engage it for a week myself, for which I will
pay you twelve.

_Clap._ But, sir, he has the first choice.

_Eben._ No, he hasn’t; he’s not of age. I am his guardian, and I want
it myself; so here’s your money. At six o’clock I shall come and take
possession.

_Clap._ But, Mr. Crotchet—

_Eben._ No more words are necessary. You keep a house for the
entertainment of gentlemen who wish a quiet place in the country. You
certainly cannot refuse so handsome an offer as I have made you.

_Clap._ But your son—

_Eben._ Has comfortable quarters at home, where he belongs. You can
inform him of my appearance here, and of the bargain I have made. Tell
him to go home and amuse himself; that I shall positively take up my
quarters here at six o’clock. (_Aside._) There’s something wrong here;
“a tender attachment,” I’ll be bound; and I’m determined to find it
out. (_Aloud._) Good day, Mr. Claptrap.

                                                           [_Exit, R._

_Clap._ Clapboard, sir—Now here’s a nice mess! What will Mr. Horace
say to this, after he has got everything comfortably arranged for his
purpose, to be flustered in this manner. It’s too bad!

                           _Enter HORACE, R._

_Horace._ I say, Clapboard, why don’t you light up your stairs? I
nearly tumbled over an old chap just now, who was going down.

_Clap._ Old chap, indeed! Do you know who it was?

_Hor._ Haven’t the least idea.

_Clap._ Well, sir, it was your father.

_Hor._ My father? Whew! Then the old gentleman has found me out!

_Clap._ He certainly has; but he’s laboring under a terrible mistake.
Some one has sent him an anonymous note, bidding him look after you,
for you had formed a tender attachment.

_Hor._ A tender attachment? That’s some mischief of the fellows at
Jobson’s. Well, what does he propose to do?

_Clap._ He’s engaged this room.

_Hor._ Engaged this room? Why, Clapboard, it’s mine—isn’t it?

_Clap._ Until six o’clock. If you’ll remember, that was the time for
which you took it.

_Hor._ But I want it a week longer.

_Clap._ You’re too late. He’s engaged it, and paid for it; and will be
here at six o’clock to take possession.

_Hor._ Clapboard, you’ve played me a shabby trick!

_Clap._ I couldn’t help it, sir; he thrust the money into my hands;
said he was your legal guardian, and told me to send you home.

_Hor._ I’ll not go until my work is finished. Well, Clapboard, let him
come; his stay shall be short.

_Clap._ What will you do?

_Hor._ That’s a question for consideration. Six months ago my father
and myself differed with regard to my choice of a profession. He wished
me to be a lawyer. I determined to be a painter. He was immovable in
his choice. I was stubborn and sullen in mine. By mutual consent we
dropped the discussion, agreeing not to renew it for a year. I was at
once filled with the desire to produce something that would induce him
to agree with me, believing that if I could show that I had talent, he
would let me have my way. I immediately threw myself into the society
of artists, and by that means gained an inkling of the rudiments of
the profession, and I found I had some talent. But how to convince
my father? I hit upon the idea of attempting a painting; something
remarkable—a great allegorical national picture, “The Crowning of
Liberty,” a magnificent idea! To carry it out, I required a studio and
living models. I read your advertisement of “Bachelors’ Paradise;”
came down, engaged a room, fitted it up, and looked around for models.
But, alas! it was indeed a “bachelors’ paradise!” Not a female figure
within three miles! Of course I was obliged to put up with the stock
on hand; and with a soldier, a sailor, a tinker, and a tailor, as the
only models to be obtained, I have been obliged to draw upon fancy to
an alarming extent; and now it seems I am to be deprived of them by my
meddling, inquisitive, good old daddy.

_Clap._ It’s too bad, Mr. Horace. I wish I could help you out of the
scrape.

_Hor._ I wish you could. But as you can’t, suppose you go and hunt up
my models, and let me get to work.

_Clap._ Certainly, sir; I’ll send them in at once.

                                                           [_Exit, R._

        (_HORACE takes off his coat and puts on breakfast jacket
      and smoking-cap, then goes off, L., and returns with an
      easel, which he sets up, L., then goes off, L., and brings
      in canvas, brushes, and palette; arranges the canvas on
      easel to face L., places chair L._)

_Clap._ (_Outside_, R., _while_ HORACE _is arranging his picture_.)
Hallo, down there, Tinpan!

_Timothy._ (_Outside, as if down stairs._) Faith, now, what’s wanting,
sure?

_Clap._ You’re wanted here.

_Tim._ All right. Be aisy, honey, till I mind the nose uv this
tay-kittle.

_Clap._ Hallo, Picket!

_Picket._ (_As if up stairs._) Yaw, mine fren.

_Clap._ You’re wanted in the studio.

_Pic._ Yaw, dat ish goot. I’ll come right avay pefore soon.

_Clap._ Hallo, Oakum!

_Oakum._ (_Up stairs._) Hallo, yerself!

_Clap._ Come down for a pose.

_Oak._ Ay, ay, Clapboard; in a jiffy.

_Clap._ Hallo, Loopstitch!

_Loopstitch._ (_In the distance._) Oui, oui, monsieur.

_Clap._ You’re wanted for a posish.

_Loop._ Vat you mean by dat, eh? Vot you call posish? I no comprehend.

_Clap._ Well, come and find out.

_Hor._ The models are aroused. Now for a season of inspiration!

                    _Enter PICKET, R., with a musket._

_Pic._ Ah, Meester Horace, how you vas? Berty mooch?

_Hor._ Ah, Picket, you’re right on hand.

_Pic._ Yaw, yaw; I ish coomed right along, by donder, mit mine gun upon
mine pack.

_Hor._ Like a true hero, and with the martial spirit inspiring your
bosom—hey?

_Pic._ Yaw, I shpose vat you mean, but I don’t know.

                              _Enter OAKUM, R._

_Oak._ Hallo! Heow are yeou anyheow? Goin’ at the picter ag’in?

_Hor._ Yes; I believe I can make my brush fly this afternoon.

_Oak._ Wal, yeou painter chaps dew beat all creation; that’s a fact.
I s’pose yeou know what yeou’re abaout; but darn me if I can see into
it. What’s the use er wastin’ yer time a flingin’ away paint on that
air diminutive quiltin’-frame. Would do more good ef yeou’d give old
Clapboard’s house a coat; it wants it bad enough!

                               _Enter LOOPSTITCH, R._

_Loop._ Sacre! vat for you want—hey? I have break off mine thread right
in de meedle of ze pantaloons.

HOR. You remember our bargain. You were to be at my service when wanted.

_Loop._ Service? Sacre, zis is too much all ze time. Monsieur Fusee
have no pantaloons; he make ze trouble, ze fuss; he raise vat you call
ze storm, if he no have ze pantaloons.

_Oak._ Well, let him sweat, Frenchy. I’ll lend him a pair.

                               _Enter TIMOTHY, R._

_Tim._ Arrah, b’ys, how are yees, onyhow? It’s the tip uv the morning
till yees, Misther Horace.

_Oak._ Hallo, Tim! How’s trade?

_Tim._ Thrade, is it? Bad luck to its! There’s none at all at all. It’s
loike the nose of Paddy Flinn’s pig—it’s away down in the mud.

_Oak._ Well, here’s hoping that, like Paddy Flinn’s pig, it may pick up
a bit.

_Tim._ That’s thrue for ye, Misther Oakum.

_Hor._ Now, then, let’s to work. Tinpan, you and Loopstitch don your
habiliments, and we’ll go to work.

_Tim._ Don—which is it?

_Loop._ Sacre! I no comprehend.

_Oak._ Darn it, Tim, jump into the Goddess of Liberty’s clos; and,
Loopstitch, put on that air gown of Victory’s.

_Tim._ Begorra! that’s a sinsible way of putting things.

                                                           [_Exit, L._

_Loop._ Victory! Oui, oui; I comprehend victory.

                                                           [_Exit, L._

_Oak._ Sich a set of darned stupid furriners I never did see.

_Pic._ Yaw; dey ish very hard of hearing, by donder!

_Oak._ Well, Picket, you managed to give us a pretty good scare last
night, walking round with that old blunderbuss! Ef yeou ain’t keerful,
yeou’ll let fly at some on us, and then there’ll be a purty case of
manslaughter.

_Pic._ Yaw; manslaughter ish goot. I like him mooch ven I fights mit
Sigel. By donder! I tink of dat ebery night in mine shleep, and I no
shleep at all.

_Oak._ Well, consarn yeour picter! deon’t yeou come up my way; if yer
du, I’ll souse yer head in a bucket of tar!

_Pic._ Yaw; I no like dat purty well.

        _Enter TIMOTHY, L., dressed as the Goddess of Liberty;
        red skirt, mail waist, blue drapery about shoulders._

_Tim._ Begorra! how’s that for a famale woman? What would Judy
O’Flanagan say to that? Tim Tinpan in a red petticoat? Whoo! kittles to
mind, kittles to mind!

        _Enter LOOPSTITCH, in a long white gown, with a green
        wreath in his hand._

_Loop._ Sacre! I feel all over like vat you call ze goost.

_Oak._ And darn me if you don’t look like one!

_Loop._ Vat you mean by dat—hey, Monsieur Oakum?

_Hor._ Come, now take your places.

_Tim._ All right; away wid yees. (_Takes position in centre of stage;
left hand against his breast, right hand pointing up._)

_Hor._ That’s right; now Victory. (_LOOPSTITCH gets upon a stool behind
TIMOTHY, and holds wreath over his head._) Very well. Now, then, for
the army and navy. (_PICKET stands R. of TIMOTHY, leaning upon his
musket; OAKUM stands L., his arms folded._) Good, good! Positions are
all right. Now, then, for the expressions.

_Tim._ Hould on a minute; there’s something crawling up my back.

_Hor._ Never mind, never mind!

_Tim._ But I do mind. It’s biting me, the ugly thief! Here, Frenchy,
give me a dig in the back.

_Loop._ Sacre! vare vill I find vat you call de spade?

_Oak._ Here; I’ll fix you. (_Gives TIMOTHY a thump on the back._)

_Tim._ Murder and Irish! you’ve broke my ribs!

_Hor._ Come, come, Tim; put a smiling expression upon your face.

_Tim._ Smile, is it, with a hornet crawling up my back!

_Hor._ We’re wasting time. Smile, I tell you.

_Tim._ Well, then, here goes. (_A horrible smile._)

_Hor._ Now, Loopstitch, triumph in _your_ face.

_Loop._ Oui, oui. Vive la triomphe!

_Hor._ That’s very good. Now, Picket, let a martial spirit glow in your
face.

_Pic._ Yaw, yaw. (_Starts, R._)

_Hor._ Where are you going?

_Pic._ For mine lager, mit de spirit up stairs.

_Hor._ No, no; you don’t understand me. Look as you looked when you met
the rebels, fierce for the fight.

_Pic._ Ven I fight mit Sigel?

_Hor._ Yes; as you did then, do now.

_Pic._ Yaw; den I’ll go right up stairs.

_Hor._ What do you mean?

_Pic._ Ven I fight mit Sigel, ven de repels coom, ve runned away.

_Oak._ What a darned sneaking coward!

_Tim._ Easy, now, Mr. Horace; my hand’s getting tired.

_Hor._ Let me see what I can do. (_Goes to easel, and takes brush._)
Now, steady, all.

_Tim._ Och, murder! the crayture’s crawling up my back again!

_Pic._ I am ash dry ash never vas.

_Hor._ Steady, steady!

_Tim._ Ow, my back! Give me a dig, Frenchy.

_Oak._ Confound you, I will! (_Hits TIMOTHY in the stomach, who doubles
up._)

_Tim._ Ow, murther, murther! (_Backs into LOOPSTITCH, who tumbles over.
TIMOTHY runs up and down stage howling._)

_Loop._ Sacre! you have broke me all to pieces.

_Hor._ Order, order! How do you suppose I can paint with such
confusion? You have spoiled everything.

_Tim._ Faith, it’s not myself that’s to blame.

_Oak._ Darn him! he’s got a nest of hornets under his jacket!

_Hor._ We can do nothing to-day. It’s now nearly six o’clock. An
individual will be here at six to take possession of my room; he has
hired it, and I must vacate.

_Oak._ What, hired the room over your head?

_Hor._ Yes; it’s a little plot of my father’s to get me home again. If
he stays here, I must give up my painting; and of course you will be
wanted no more as models.

_Loop._ Sacre! zat is too bad! ver mooch too bad!

_Tim._ Faith! must I lose my sitivation?

_Pic._ Yaw; we can’t come here some more!

_Hor._ That’s exactly the state of the case. Of course, as he’s my
father, it will not do for me to take any measures to cause him to
leave. With you it is different. If you can manage to make him sick of
his bargain to-night, we shall resume operations to-morrow, as usual.

_Oak._ Darn him, we’ll pitch him out of the winder!

_Hor._ No, no; no violence!

_Tim._ No, b’ys; no voilence. We’ll break his head intirely! That’s all.

_Hor._ He’s very particular to have everything about him quiet. I
offer no suggestions. If you can manage to scare him a little, I’ve no
objections.

_Tim._ Faith, lave us alone for that.

_Oak._ Come to my room, boys; we’ll fix the old skinflint! Come along.

_Tim._ Yaw; flint ish goot ven I fight mit Sigel.

_Oak._ O, never mind Seagull. Come along.

_Loop._ Sacre! Vat you fix his flint with? I no comprehend.

_Oak._ I’ll fix everything all right. Leave it to me. Come along.

                                                             [_Exit, R._

_Tim._ I’m wid yees. If there’s to be a shindy, count me in. [_Exit, R._

_Loop._ Monsieur, I be vat you call in ze dark ver much all over.

_Pic._ Yaw, it pe all covered mit de dark like de moonshine.
                                       [_Exit LOOPSTITCH and PICKET, R._

_Hor._ What a set of stupid donkeys! If they manage to circumvent my
respected parent, I’ll forgive them. (_Exchanges jacket for coat, and
puts on hat. Stage dark._) How dark it is!

_Clap._ (_Outside, R._) You’re very prompt, sir.

_Eben._ (_Outside, R._) I am always prompt. Is the room ready?

_Clap._ (_Outside, R._) Yes, sir; walk this way.

_Hor._ There he is, right on time. There’s sure to be a rumpus, and I’m
bound to see the fun.                                       [_Exit, L._

    _Enter CLAPBOARD, with a lighted candle, which he places
               on table, followed by EBENEZER._

_Eben._ Now, sir, I’ve caught you at your tricks! Why, he’s gone!

_Clap._ Why, you certainly didn’t expect to find him here.

_Eben._ I certainly did. Where is he?

_Clap._ He’s probably at Jobson’s, over the way. But he’ll be back
soon. He’ll be delighted to see you.

_Eben._ Clapboard, you lie! you know he won’t.

_Clap._ Come, come, Mr. Crotchet, don’t insult a man in his own room.

_Eben._ ’Tis false! it’s my room; and you may take yourself out of it
just as soon as you can!

_Clap._ You don’t mean to stay here!

_Eben._ Yes, I do. I’ve had another note from my unknown correspondent.
The object of his tender attachment visits him every evening, and I’m
bound to see her.

_Clap._ O, pshaw, Mr. Crotchet! you’ve been humbugged!

_Eben._ I know it; but I’ll be humbugged no longer; so here I’ll stay
to unmask the hypocrite!

_Clap._ Well, stay, then; but if you’re made uncomfortable, don’t blame
me.

_Eben._ What do you mean?

_Clap._ No matter; I’ve cautioned you. Keep your eyes open, and don’t
blame me. Remember you have been cautioned. Good night.

                                                           [_Exit, R._

_Eben._ Clapboard, Clapboard—What does he mean? Can there be any
danger? I’m an old fool! What business have I down in this unfrequented
place, all alone? I’ll go back. No, I won’t! Horace would laugh and
chuckle! He shan’t do that! Who’s afraid? I’ll make myself comfortable
on that lounge; and when he comes, he shall learn how terrible is the
vengeance of an enraged and injured parent. (_Reclines upon lounge.
Noise overhead; jumps up._) What’s that? It’s that infernal soldier!
Clapboard said he walks in his sleep. Suppose he should come here—with
a loaded musket too! Gracious! (_Trombone heard outside._) There’s the
tailor practising. What a confounded din!

_Oak._ (_Sings, outside, very loud._) “My bark is on the sea.”

_Eben._ There’s that sailor going it!

_Tim._ (_Outside, sings._) “Ould kittles to mind! Ould kittles to mind!”

_Eben._ And there’s the tinker. (_Trombone, “ould kittles,” and “bark
upon the sea,” all together._) What a confounded din! I wish I was well
out of it.

            _Enter PICKET, with musket, slowly, on tiptoe._

_Pic._ Who goes dare?

_Eben._ O, heavens! There’s that insane old grenadier! What will become
of me?

_Pic._ Sh—! By donder, I see some noise! Sh—! Who goes dare? Sh—!
Somepody mit a gun. Advance pefore you speak, and say something. Sh—!
(_Creeps about the room on tiptoe._)

_Eben._ (_On lounge._) If he discovers me, I am a lost man!

_Pic._ By donder, if dare ish nopody here, vy don’t you speak? You vant
your coat-tails shot through mit a pullet. (_Creeps back to door, R._)
I fight mit Sigel. Sh—! By donder! I never hear so mooch silence pefore!

                                                           [_Exit, R._

_Eben._ He’s gone. I breathe again. O, Lord, what’s that? (_LOOPSTITCH
in the white robe passes slowly across stage, from R. to L., with his
arm outstretched, hand pointing straight before him. Exit, L._) An
apparition! What infernal place have I got into? I’ll go home at once.
(_Goes to R. The door is locked. LOOPSTITCH, without the robe, creeps
in, L., and gets behind lounge._)

_Loop._ Sacre! I vill give him a touch of my needles!

_Eben._ What an old donkey I am, to get into such a scrape! What shall
I do? I can’t get out. Suppose I alarm the neighborhood! That won’t do;
I should have the whole set upon me. I’ll try to sleep. (_Lies upon
lounge. LOOPSTITCH leans over and runs a needle into his arm._) O,
murder! What’s that? Confound this infernal place! (_LOOPSTITCH sticks
another needle._) O, my arm, my arm! (_Jumps up._) I can’t stand this!
Here! Help, help, help, help!

    _Enter OAKUM, R. Creeps in very mysteriously; takes EBENEZER
      by the wrist, and leads him down to the front of the
      stage._

_Oak._ Silence! Sh—!

_Eben._ O, take me out of this! I’m a poor old man.

_Oak._ Silence! Sh—! Listen to me. You received a note from somebody—

_Eben._ Yes, I did. Confound somebody!

_Oak._ Silence! Sh—! “Tender attachment!” It’s all true, by jiminy!

_Eben._ I knew it.

_Oak._ Your son—has a tender attachment. The object of it is
approaching. It will soon be here.

_Eben._ You don’t say so!

_Oak._ Old man, you have a son; that son has a tender attachment; the
object of that tender attachment—sh—!—will soon be here.

_Eben._ Confound you, you said that before!

_Oak._ Be wise, be cautious, and you shall triumph. Silence! It comes!
the—object—comes! (_Creeps off, R._)

_Eben._ Well, that’s the queerest customer that ever I met. Hallo!
who’s this?

    _Enter TIMOTHY, dressed as the Goddess of Liberty, with a
      veil thrown over his face._

’Tis she, at last! Now to unmask the villain!

_Tim._ Idol of me sowl!

_Eben._ Irish, as I’m alive!

_Tim._ Och, yees illigent darlint! and did yees think yer own Kathleen,
accushla, would deny yees the comfort of her prisence?

_Eben._ So, madam, you are found out! Know, to your sorrow, that you
stand in the presence of the father of the unhappy young man you came
to meet?

_Tim._ It’s the ould man—is it? Faith, ould chap, how is yes, onyhow?

_Eben._ Insolent!

_Tim._ It’s a foine-looking ould fellow yees are; and is that yer own
hair, or is it a wig, I’d like to know.

_Eben._ Young woman, no more of this. I came to snatch my son from your
society.

_Tim._ My society! Faix, yes might do better. It’s a comfort I am to
him anyhow. You would be afther parting us at all at all!

_Eben._ Hold your tongue, and leave the room!

_Tim._ Hould yees blarney yerself, or I’ll—I’ll pull the hair from your
head!

_Eben._ Leave this room, instantly, or I’ll put you out!

_Tim._ You put me out, is it? Begorra! the sooner yees commince that
same, the better’s to the liking of Tim Tiupan.

_Eben._ (_Taking hold of him._) Leave the room, I say!

_Tim._ Off wid yees, or I’ll break ivery bone in yees body!

_Eben._ You will—will you? (_Takes hold of him._)

_Tim._ (_Throws off veil._) Arrah, boys, here’s a shindy! Come on, old
gint! (_Flourishes his fist._)

_Eben._ Here! Help, help, help! (_TIMOTHY clinches him._) Leave the
room!

    _Enter HORACE, L., OAKUM, CLAPBOARD, and PICKET, R.
      LOOPSTITCH crawls from behind lounge._

_Hor._ Why, father! what’s the matter?

_Eben._ O, you villain! you scamp! you renegade! You have come just
in time to save your father from a terrible fate! But I’ve found you
out! Your “tender attachment” is known to me. Look upon her! Can you
look upon your father’s face, and confess a tender attachment to such a
thing as that?

_Hor._ Not a tender attachment, father; but I will confess I am under
great obligations to that individual, Timothy Tinpan, the tinker.

_Eben._ What! is that woman a man?

_Tim._ Troth, and a foine ould Irish gintleman!

_Hor._ Yes, father, he is one of my models.

_Tim._ Faith, a model Irishman, by yer lave!

_Eben._ Models! What do you mean?

_Hor._ That I have been endeavoring to overcome your repugnance to my
becoming a painter, by attempting the execution of a painting which you
see upon that easel. These individuals have been my models. Timothy
Tinpan, the tinker.

_Tim._ That’s me, sure.

_Hor._ Obed Oakum, the sailor.

_Oak._ Ay, ay; second mate of the Harriet Jones.

_Hor._ Louis Loopstitch, the tailor.

_Loop._ Oui, oui; sal I make you a pair of pantaloons, monsieur?

_Hor._ And Peter Picket, the soldier.

_Pic._ Yaw, dat ish me, mit my gun upon mine pack.

_Eben._ What, and the note I received—

_Hor._ Is one of Harry Jones’s jokes. He confessed it to me an hour ago.

_Eben._ Clapboard, we’ve been making donkeys of ourselves!

_Clap._ Speak for yourself, Mr. Crotchet, I can’t join you in that.

_Eben._ Horace, I’m a meddling old fool. I should have trusted you.
I’ll go home. You may go on with your picture; and if out of the
material which I find here you can produce anything satisfactory, I’ll
give my consent to anything you ask.

_Hor._ Thank you, father. I’m rather discouraged at present; but if
these individuals can cure you of “a tender attachment,” they may be of
use to me; and if they can help me to achieve my purpose, you will be
obliged to admit that there are worse companions than a soldier—

_Pic._ Yaw, what fight mit Sigel.

_Hor._ A sailor—

_Oak._ Tarnal cute, when his bark’s on the sea.

_Hor._ A tinker—

_Tim._ A broth of a boy for minding the broken nose of a tay-kittle.

_Hor._ And a tailor—

_Loop._ Oui, oui; vith vat you call ze tender attachment for ze needle.

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
